# Tracking my Journey

This is a personal repo to track my ongoing journey as I learn.

This is it. 

I will add presentations, thoughts, guides, workshops and whatever else I create
on this journey.

This is not restricted to CS.

The info here might be wrong, but have fun reading stuff I add and if you want to point out any mistake, just do it. 
Learning more is always appreciated.
